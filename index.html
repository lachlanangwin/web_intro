      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am starting out on my journey in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), with a particular focus on Cyber Security.  I have just completed my Certificate IV in Cyber Security at Holmesglen, I am regularly practicing and studying what I have learnt as well as trying to continuously learn new things.  I am interested in all areas of Cyber Security including, networking, system hardening, penetration testing, incident response, blue, purple, and red teams, virtual machines, Linux, and cloud computing.  I would like to continue growing my Linux skills and programming in Python as well as cementing my knowledge of Web Design, HTML and CSS. I have previously owned my own Company, I love Coffee and I am a level 2 Barista.</p>
